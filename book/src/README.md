# Rust & QT workshop

This workbook contains the material for a Rust & QT workshop held by [Ferrous Systems](https://ferrous-systems.com/), developed and held together with [KDAB](https://kdab.com). It is based on work by [Jan-Erik Rediger](https://fnordig.de/).

It is split into 3 parts:

## Part 1: [Setup](preparations.md)

An installation guide for all tooling used throughout this book.

## Part 2: [Background](what-is-webassembly.md)

A bit of common knowledge & history about WebAssembly and Rust,
as well as notable use cases.

## Part 3: [Tutorial](./tutorial/index.md)

A hands-on tutorial writing Rust and compiling it in 3 variations: as a command-line app, as a library and as a small QT app using the library using cxx-qt.
