# Edge

In this tutorial you'll get familiar with:

* Building for Fastly's Compute@Edge platform
* Handling and responding to a web request
* A little bit of HTML and JavaScript for the frontend

We build a web API that applies a given filter to an image posted to it.
It returns the produced image over HTTP.
Additionally we also serve a bare-bones HTML form that allows us to use this API.
