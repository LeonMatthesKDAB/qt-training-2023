# Image filter application

Our image filter application provides 3 endpoints:

**`GET /`**

The HTML frontend to load, post and display images.

**`GET /app.js`**

The JavaScript frontend code to handle the logic of sending and displaying the image.

**`POST /image`**

The actual image filter API.
It receives the image in the request body and returns the converted image.
