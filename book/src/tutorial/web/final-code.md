# Final application

To recap your final Rust code should look something like this:

```rust
{{#include ../../../../crates/web/src/lib.rs}}
```

The frontend in HTML:

```html
{{#include ../../../../crates/web/src/index.html}}
```

The JavaScript frontend code:

```javascript
{{#include ../../../../crates/web/src/app.js}}
```

The JavaScript worker code:

```javascript
{{#include ../../../../crates/web/src/worker.js}}
```
