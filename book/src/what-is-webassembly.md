# What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly is a technology that allows you to compile application code written in pretty much any language
(including Rust, C, C++, JavaScript, and Go)
and run it inside sandboxed environments.
WebAssembly is often known as just "wasm".

Contrary to what the name might make you believe it is not tied to the web only.
But the web is where it originated.

WebAssembly started in 2015, with a first release of the specification in 2017.
By 2019 it became an official web standard with implementations across all major browsers.
